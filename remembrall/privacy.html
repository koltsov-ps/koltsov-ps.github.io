			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in Remembrall app.</p>

			<h3>CloudKit and iCloud</h3>

			<p>Remembrall uses Apple CloudKit to sync data between your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad). Your data is stored in a private database, which is encrypted with an account-based key. Therefore, I do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. I also do not have access to your Apple ID, only a unique identifier that is linked to only our app. It is not possible to track your identity between apps with this identifier.<br/>

			</p>

			<h3>Personal Data</h3>
			<p>Personal data is information that can identify you. This includes contact details when you write to me or contact me online (e.g. name, postal address, email address and phone number).</p>

			<h3>Email and Communication</h3>

			<p>Remembrall app contains information that enables you to contact me via email. If you contact me via email, the transmitted personal data is stored.</p>

			<h3>Firebase Analytics</h3>

			<p>I collect anonymized usage statistics concerning your use of Remembrall app using Google Firebase, a service of Google LLC (“Google”). Therefore google collects information about your use of the app (including your IP address). This data will be transferred and saved to a Google server in the USA. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the App, compiling reports on the app's activities within the App for me, and providing other services relating to the use of the App and the internet. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.<br/>

			For more information about how Google uses your information, please see Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a>
			</p>

			<p>The data stored at Firebase Analytics is stored for a period of 14 months. After this period, Firebase Analytics only stores aggregated statistics.<br/>
			Firebase Analytics is used on the basis of my legitimate interest in a needs-based design, statistical evaluation and efficient advertising of Remembrall app.
			</p>

			<h3>Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
			<p>I use Firebase Crashlytics, a service of Google LLC. Crashlytics transmits certain technical information to me concerning your device and your app installation if Remembrall app crashes. We use this data only in order to determine the reason for the crash and to remove errors in the app. This data is not personal data.</p>

			<p>Crashlytics is used based on my legitimate interest in recognizing errors in my app, examining them and remedying them, and to thus be able to offer the app in its contractually stipulated form.</p>

			<h3>Your Consent</h3>
			<p>By using my app, you consent to my privacy policy.</p>

			<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
			<p>If I decide to change this privacy policy, I will post those changes on this page.</p>
