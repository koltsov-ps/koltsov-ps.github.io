			<h2>Remembrall</h2>

			<p>
				Remembrall is a new simple application for memorization and repetition of information (new foreign words, rules) using cards.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application is based on the spaced repetition method. The cards are created manually or with the help of the import of CSV file. The first column of this file is filled by information for the upper side of the cards, in the second column â€” for the lower side. 
			</p>

			<p>There is a text-to-speech for cards in English.</p>			
			<p>In the next release we are going to support Dark Theme and synchronization between devices via iCloud.</p>

			<p>The application supports iOS 9+</p>
